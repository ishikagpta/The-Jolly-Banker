# The-Jolly-Banker

The Jolly Banker is a banking application consisting of three phases:  

1) The program will read in a string of transactions from a file into an in-memory queue. These transactions can open accounts, withdraw funds, deposit funds, transfer funds, or ask for the transactional history to be printed.

2) The program will next read from the queue and process the transactions in order.

3)  When the queue has been depleted the program will print out all open accounts and balances in those accounts.
